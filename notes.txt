3.READ ABOUT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WINDOW,SCREEN AND DOCUMENT IN JAVASCRIPT...?

Briefly, with more detail below,

* window is the execution context and global object for that context's JavaScript
* screen describes the physical display's full screen         
* document contains the DOM, initialized by parsing HTML             

1.window

Each browser tab has its own top-level window object. 
Each <iframe> (and deprecated <frame>) element has its own window object too, nested within a parent window.

setTimeout() and setInterval() binding event handlers to a timer
location giving the current URL
history with methods back() and forward() giving the tab's mutable history
navigator describing the browser software

2.screen

The window object also has a screen object with properties describing the physical display:

screen properties width and height are the full screen
screen properties availWidth and availHeight omit the toolbar

3.document

Each window object has a document object to be rendered. 
These objects get confused in part because HTML elements are added to the global object when assigned a unique id.
E.g., in the HTML snippet

<body>
  <p id="holyCow"> This is the first paragraph.</p>
</body>

the paragraph element can be referenced by any of the following:

window.holyCow or window["holyCow"]
document.getElementById("holyCow")
document.querySelector("#holyCow")
document.body.firstChild
document.body.children[0]
